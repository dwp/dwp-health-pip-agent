            He was diagnosed by his GP in 2012 and started on pain relief. He tried different medications for pain which did not work. He then took Tramadol (pain relief) for 4 years, he then moved to America for a while, took pain relief there but came off this. He no longer takes Tramadol but does use over the counter pain relief. <br><br> He was referred to pain management but did not attend as the referral was lost - he states that he has since been re-referred to the pain management service 1 month ago.<br><br> He states that his GP has discussed him being referred to weight managed as he nearly obese on the weight scale (BMI - body mass index). He has not been referred to any other services. <br><br> Day to day he experiences symptoms of forgetfulness - fibro fog, feeling overpowered with pain in his shoulders (worse on the right side), lower right side of his back and hip as well as both ankles where he has a lot of tension when he walks. His knees and elbows are ok. <br><br> He suffers with fatigue also but is not sure what is related to his sleep apnoea. He feels that his symptoms have worsened over time, more so since 2021. He reports no variability. He has not needed to stay in hospital as a result of this.
            <br><br>
            Myofacial pain syndrome (long term pain condition were pressure on areas - trigger points, causes pain). He was diagnosed by a specialist last year. He was referred to an orthodontist due to him wearing a mouth guard for 20 years but there is no other treatment planned. He experiences pain symptoms - he is unable to differentiate this from his fibromyalgia pain and this follows the same above history. He takes over the counter pain relief but feels that his left sided jaw pain is the worst.

          PIP2 - Reports issues with muscle flinching in his right arm.

          <br><br>HOC shows that he is under GP care for his back and fibromyalgia, having just been referred to pain clinic. MT shows that he takes no prescribed pain relief and only OTC anti inflammatory pain and as required mild pain relief.

          <br><br>HOC shows arm flinching but there is no FE to support significant restriction with this. FH in activity 4 - washing and bathing, shows that he still wet shaves himself which is unlikely to support significant risk from any flinching when there is no reported trigger. The above FH reports that he has just cut himself once as a result of his flinching when preparing food in the kitchen.

          <br><br>HOC shows that he has sleep apnoea and whilst he reports fatigue as an issue, he is only needing to take a 20 minute nap in the day normally to feel refreshed.
