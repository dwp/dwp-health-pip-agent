          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
            Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), avoidant personality disorder (AVPD) anxiety, depression, psychotic episodes and schizoaffective disorder. He had a voluntary stay in a mental health unit in April 2023. He feels that he may also have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or non-organic psychosis. Any further diagnosis is ongoing, he is under the care of the CMHT and sees a therapist weekly online and sees a psychiatrist every 4 months. He has recently moved to this team. He has been under various mental health teams since the age of 14 and this has been almost consistent since the age of 14. His problems started earlier than this but he first saw the MHT team at 14. He has been flagged to CRISIS recently and they have advised that he is seen more by the MHT. Previously, he was an inpatient in hospital for his mental health in Summer 2022 for 2 days whilst in Sweden. He is in receipt of multiple medications for this, has been for a long time, there have been no changes on the medication for several months.

            <br><br>Day to day he experiences symptoms of suicidal harm thoughts and self harm urges. Low mood, empty and hollow with low motivation. Fear of abandonment which makes his suicidal ideation worse. Emotional flashback situations, experiences with thoughts and memories, violent in nature or not pleasant. He suffers with intrusive thoughts all of the time and this becomes worse when he is not focused on something, he loses track of time, recent and long term (he has to keep a planner as a result). He has disassociation daily and avoidance anxiety - does not see people enough as a result. He will lash out when he is upset and distressed - this is verbally on a daily basis, to anyone who is nearby. This is due to reactive volatile moods. He suffers with psychotic elements - has background talking which is distracting but not intrusive. He has a fear of public paces, suffers with impulsive behaviour - when he is upset or manic, occurring most days. He suffers with sleep issues and states that he gets lost when he goes out anywhere. There is variability within the day but he has no good days in general. His symptoms can become worse due to his joint pains.

            <br><br>With his intrusive thoughts - these are violent in nature or violent loops of intrusion where they can also tell him to harm himself. This results in him not being able to function, struggles to focus and becomes distressed and upset where he struggles to communicate with people. He is experiencing these symptoms weekly but is unclear how often.
            He has a low level of disassociation all of the time. Twice a week, this becomes more severe where his partner needs to support him to bring him out of the phase and that he does not harm himself. His symptoms have gotten worse over the years. He last attempted suicide one month ago - he went to A&E at the time after an overdose of sleeping tablets. Prior to this was in December 2023 with an overdose. He normally attempts every 3-4 months on average and has a long history of overdosing. He suffers with suicidal ideation daily, there are always passing thoughts but does have plans to overdosing, or walking into traffic - this can be 3 times a week. He only has his prescriptions for 1 week at a time due to his history of overdosing. He has protective factors of his partner but this does not stop him from attempting suicide if he is able to. He has a history of self harm, last did this 2 days where he cut his arm. This is caused by when he is upset, he wants to kill himself but he can't. He has thoughts of self harming weekly and normally does this monthly and has a long history of this. His GP and mental health team are aware.

            <br><br>Gender Identity Dysphoria. He had in February 2023 a Bilateral mastectomy (breasts removed) and nipple grafts. He is under a specialist for this, takes a hormone for this, he has requested more surgery and is awaiting approval. There were no problems with his surgery. Pronouns are He/him. He sees the specialist ad hoc. He has seen them twice in the last 6 months. He does not like being out in public as a result of his dysphoria as this makes him feel anxious in himself.

            <br><br>Autism and ADHD - he has had recent diagnosis of autism and ADHD after an assessment but feels that he has had symptoms for a long time. He had a Special education needs coordinator (SENCO) lead at school weekly and an occupational therapist - had computer use and extra time in exams. He is not sure if he had an educational healthcare plan (EHCP). He was also allowed to wear ear plugs in school. He is going to meet with an Occupational therapist (OT) in the future to establish what support he can have for the future. He finds it hard to interact with people, especially new people, does not understand what is going on and finds this anxiety inducing. He is not able to maintain relationships. He struggles to be in noisy environments and finds this overwhelming. He feels that he has had these symptoms a lot longer than what they have been diagnosed. He struggles with sensory issues - loud noises, wet hands, high necks, being touched, strong smells. These are made worse by going outside. His symptoms are not variable unless he is outside and overall since secondary school they have not worsened.

            <br><br>Allergies (since 9 months old). Was not officially diagnosed until he was 9 years old. He is under the care of his GP and takes an antihistamine. This relates to his asthma, was under a specialist for this as a child in conjunction with his asthma but no longer sees a specialist for both, there has been a good improvement. This is well controlled with medication but in winter he gets Cold urticaria (skin reacts to cold) and he is unable to do anything about this however will stay indoors most of the time due to his anxiety. There are no other plans for treatment. He reports no effects to his daily function.

            <br><br>Asthma (since 9 months old). Was not officially diagnosed until he was 9 years old. He suffered with asthma attacks and hospital admissions until the age of 19. He is under the care of his GP now, takes asthma medication which is largely effective and has only needed to take once course of steroids in the large year at the beginning of a chest infection. Day to day is breathless more easily than other people but not much more so and feels that this is well controlled now. His last asthma attack was over a year ago.

            <br><br>Migraines - they started as a teenager and has worsened in his 20's. He was under a neurologist, they changed his medication and discharged him. His migraines have improved over time but does have migraines every 2 weeks approximately, lasting from 2 hours to 2 days, where he is is not able to do very much. Normally he does not have an aura.

            <br><br>Hypermobility syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos or EDS) This was diagnosed in 2022/2023 by a rheumatologist. He had physiotherapy which did not help. Has been referred to the pain clinic, he has an assessment some time in April 2024. Has daily joint pain from doing things - affecting his wrist and hands (caused by using his computer). When he goes for walks, he will not be able to do anything else for the rest of the day due to lower limb joint pains. He has tried over the counter pain relief but these have not worked. He is awaiting pain clinic review. He has attended A&E for this pain in 2022 as the joint pain was very bad.
            The pain has worsened over time. He has also been told that the fatigue symptoms that he experiences are as a result of his EDS by his rheumatologist. He has bad days where he is not able to leave the house due to fatigue - at least one day a week. He does suffer fatigue daily and takes supplements for this.

            <br><br>Sight loss (occasional) - this may be due to migraine or this could be related to his EDS, this has been checked in A&E after he went there with vision loss when he had no migraine. He suffers with partial sight loss (1/3 of the time when he has migraines).
            His vision is blurry and he cannot distinguish shapes.
            He has not been referred to an eye specialist and there are no other plans for treatment.

            <br><br>Dizziness and fainting - he has been experiencing this since he was a teenager but this has worsened over time. This can occur when he changes position or when he stands. His rheumatologist told him that it could be related to his EDS. He has had cariology tests which came back normal. There are no other plans for treatment and takes no medication for this. He has not attended A&E as a result of his fainting. He feels dizzy when he stands up, this is some days in the week but not most days. He last felt dizzy a few days ago getting a plate from a cupboard. He last fainted some time ago, over 6 months ago. He feels that everything zooms quickly, is dizzy and then faints. He states that this does not occur very often and was vague about other details of fainting.

            <br><br>Vocal cord dysfunction. He was diagnosed in 2016 by specialist and has had no surgery. He is no longer under a specialist and there are no further plans for treatment. Sometimes his breathing can be affected as a result of this (main symptom). He states that he cannot run as a result of this and reports no other symptoms. His symptoms have stayed the same over time, he reports that his vocal cord dysfunction was only evident during asthma attacks.

            <br><br>No other medical problems reported during the assessment.

He struggles all of the time due to his motivation. On his good days, he will cook whilst supported by his partner due to his disassociation and intrusive thoughts as well as his suicidal and self-harm ideation.

HOC and MT shows a diagnosis of EUPD, AVPD, anxiety, depression, psychosis, schizoaffective disorder, intrusive thoughts has disassociation (this is daily. He will lash out when he is upset and  attendance.

There is multiple FE to support him being under mental health services.
<br><br>MSE showed he was anxious during the assessment, had rapid speech and was clearly uncomfortable with the assessment.
<br><br>This is overall medically consistent with the reported restriction in the FH.
<br><br>It is likely that he cannot follow the route of a familiar journey without another person, an assistance dog or an orientation aid on the majority of days, to ensure safety, timeliness, that it is done to an acceptable standard and repeatedly.
Whilst cannot follow the route of an unfamiliar journey without another person, assistance dog or orientation aid has been considered as per
questionnaire.
<br><br>This has is likely to have been superseded by cannot follow the route of a familiar
journey without another person.
<br><br>FH does show that he is able to go out on the majority of days with
support and encouragement from their partner, assisting him to manage his OPD symptoms, as well
mitigating risk of harm to himself and others from his lashing out and impulsive behaviour.
<br><br>He is supposed to go to University once a week in the taxi funded for
him but he is unable to go most of the time due to his anxiety and has not been in 6 weeks and is not managing to attend even half of the the classes.
<br><br>Whilst can plan and follow the route of a journey unaided has been considered as per previous report, this has likely to have been superseded by the need
for support from another person with familiar journeys.
<br><br>Performing this task unaided is inadequate
based on the level of support required in his FH, corroborated by the multiple conditions for his mental health reported in the HOC inclusive of the treatment and symptoms as well as the more recent diagnosis of autism and ADHD.

            He is able to manage at a slow to normal pace to go for 20 minute walks, 3-4 days a week. He does not use any aid but will take 1-2 variable in length

            <br><br>In addition to these walks, at least once
            weekly, he is able to walk 10 minutes to the shop, wil walk around the shop for 20 minutes and then walks home, this is at a slow to normal pace. He will stop for rest at the supermarket before carrying on the with the 20 minute shop, then walks home for 10 minutes carrying some of the shopping. On the other days he wil mobilise around the house but would not be able to go out due to his anxiety.
            <br><br>He did classify that he is able to walk 200 metres or more at time on the days that he does not go out for walks or to the shops despite his pain and fatigue, doing so unaided and without needing a break.

              <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">

                HOC shows that he is not under specialist care and takes no medication for his dizziness nor fainting. He was only able to recall one episode of fainting 6 months ago. Whilst he has been referred to the pain clinic for his EDS, he is not currently in receipt of any pain relief and reports that he is unable to go out one day a week due to his EDS causing fatigue, which is not on the majority of days. He reports that his asthma is now stable.
                Whilst there if FE confirming EDS diagnosis, there is none to confirm significant restriction in this activity with regards to being able to stand from the toilet and clean themselves nor any continence issues.
                10 showed no expression of pain during the assessment. There was no evidence of wheeze or
                breathlessness during the assessment. He did not
                sound tired during the assessment.
                There is no restriction noted in their previous report.
                This is medically consistent with the lack of significant restriction reported in the FH and questionnaire.
                It is likely that he can stand and then move more than 200 metres, either aided or unaided on the
                majority of days, to ensure safety, timeliness, that ti is done to an acceptable standard and repeatedly.
