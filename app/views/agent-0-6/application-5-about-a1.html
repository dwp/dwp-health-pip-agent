      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">I struggle to prepare meals, so often don't bother. When I do make meals, I sometimes forget the oven or pan is on. I can usually manage to make sandwiches no problem though.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">I quite often get meals from a local drop-in centre as it's easier.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Jeff's care plan outlines the difficulty he has with preparing food and I agree with its findings.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Jeff has difficulty preparing meals for himself. He can make himself drinks and sandwiches but needs to be supervised to make a meal.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Jeff lacks the drive to prepare a meal regularly and tends to break off from cooking and this has resulted in him burning food and leaving pans to boil over.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">Jeff obtains most of his full meals from the drop-in centre and his support worker supervises him to put ready-made meals in the oven twice a week. During periods of low mood, he does not respond readily to prompting and will not make himself meals.</p>
