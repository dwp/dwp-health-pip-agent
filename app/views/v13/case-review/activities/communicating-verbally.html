   <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">I am incredibly anxious about meeting new people as I have a very hard time with how to interact in surface level conversations. Further, I cannot maintain relationships for any extended period of time, my relationships are intense and unstable and end up exploding and leaving all parties deeply unhappy with the outcome. Because of this I avoid making friends and talking to people because getting hurt in this way is really destabilising for my mental health. </p>

       <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">OSA causes tiredness which leads to slurred speech when I'm tired in the afternoon. People have comments at times when I seem to be mumbling. A mouth guard I wear has moved my jaw forward over the 20 years I have been wearing it and I do at time have difficulty in pronouncing words. </p>
