      <p class="govuk-body">Most days I have difficulty making decisions about bills and household budgets because I become very anxious and panicked.
        My partner helps me make financial decisions. <br>  <br>
always have difficulty paying for things in shops because I find it difficult to calculate how much things cost. My carer helps me understand how much I need to pay.</p>

As the flinches are involuntary when I peel carrots (for example), I occasionally flinch and this causes me to push beyond the end of the carrot. I am right-handed. The muscle flinching is being evaluated as it could be a result of central nervous system activity. </p>
