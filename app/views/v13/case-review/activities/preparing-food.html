        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">I am pretty much always too fatigued to make the food that I actually want to make, it takes too much effort to think of al the steps, to read the recipe to carry ti out. I also get very overwhelmed by the kitchen, where everything is, whether it's where it's meant to be and things like that. As Ilive with other people, this is obviously a problem. Further, once or twice a week, usually near the end, Iâ€™ll have to sit on the floor whenever I am not actively tending to the stove or doing something like this due to dizziness and joint pain.</p>

         <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">The muscle flinching in my right arm is worsening. The muscle finching started in 2016. As the flinches are involuntary when I peel carrots (for example), I occasionally flinch and this causes me to push beyond the end of the carrot. I am right-handed. The muscle flinching is being evaluated as it could be a result of central nervous system activity. </p>
