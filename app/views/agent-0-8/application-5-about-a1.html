      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Your care plan ('Care plan 2022' on DRS) outlines the difficlty you have with preparing food and I agree with its findings.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">You have difficulty preparing meals. You can make yourself drinks and sandwiches but need to be supervised to make a meal.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">You lack the drive to prepare a meal regularly and tend to break off from cooking and this has resulted in you burning food and leaving pans to boil over.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">You get most of your full meals from the drop-in centre and your support worker supervises you to put ready-made meals in the oven twice a week. During periods of low mood, Jeff does not respond readily to prompting and will not make yourself meals.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">This is why I have selected 1E.</p>
