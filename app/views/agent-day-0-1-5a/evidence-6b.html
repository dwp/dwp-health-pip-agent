            <strong>Emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD)</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
            Avoidant personality disorder (AVPD) anxiety, depression, psychotic episodes and schizoaffective disorder.<br>He had a voluntary stay in a mental health unit in April 2023. <br><br>He feels that he may also have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or non-organic psychosis. Any further diagnosis is ongoing, he is under the care of the CMHT and sees a therapist weekly online and sees a psychiatrist every 4 months. He has recently moved to this team. He has been under various mental health teams since the age of 14 and this has been almost consistent since the age of 14. His problems started earlier than this but he first saw the MHT team at 14. He has been flagged to CRISIS recently and they have advised that he is seen more by the MHT. <br><br>Previously, he was an inpatient in hospital for his mental health in Summer 2022 for 2 days whilst in Sweden. He is in receipt of multiple medications for this, has been for a long time, there have been no changes on the medication for several months.

            <br><br>Day to day he experiences symptoms of suicidal harm thoughts and self harm urges. Low mood, empty and hollow with low motivation. Fear of abandonment which makes his suicidal ideation worse. Emotional flashback situations, experiences with thoughts and memories, violent in nature or not pleasant. He suffers with intrusive thoughts all of the time and this becomes worse when he is not focused on something, he loses track of time, recent and long term (he has to keep a planner as a result). He has disassociation daily and avoidance anxiety - does not see people enough as a result. He will lash out when he is upset and distressed - this is verbally on a daily basis, to anyone who is nearby. <br><br>This is due to reactive volatile moods. He suffers with psychotic elements - has background talking which is distracting but not intrusive. He has a fear of public paces, suffers with impulsive behaviour - when he is upset or manic, occurring most days. He suffers with sleep issues and states that he gets lost when he goes out anywhere. There is variability within the day but he has no good days in general. His symptoms can become worse due to his joint pains.

            <br><br>With his intrusive thoughts - these are violent in nature or violent loops of intrusion where they can also tell him to harm himself. This results in him not being able to function, struggles to focus and becomes distressed and upset where he struggles to communicate with people. He is experiencing these symptoms weekly but is unclear how often.
            He has a low level of disassociation all of the time. <br><br>Twice a week, this becomes more severe where his partner needs to support him to bring him out of the phase and that he does not harm himself. <br><br>His symptoms have gotten worse over the years. He last attempted suicide one month ago - he went to A&E at the time after an overdose of sleeping tablets. Prior to this was in December 2023 with an overdose. He normally attempts every 3-4 months on average and has a long history of overdosing. He suffers with suicidal ideation daily, there are always passing thoughts but does have plans to overdosing, or walking into traffic - this can be 3 times a week. <br><br>He only has his prescriptions for 1 week at a time due to his history of overdosing. He has protective factors of his partner but this does not stop him from attempting suicide if he is able to. He has a history of self harm, last did this 2 days where he cut his arm. This is caused by when he is upset, he wants to kill himself but he can't. He has thoughts of self harming weekly and normally does this monthly and has a long history of this. His GP and mental health team are aware.

            He had in February 2023 a Bilateral mastectomy (breasts removed) and nipple grafts.

He sees the specialist ad hoc. He has seen them twice in the last 6 months. He does not like being out in public as a result of his dysphoria as this makes him feel anxious in himself.

          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
             He has had recent diagnosis of autism and ADHD after an assessment but feels that he has had symptoms for a long time. He had a Special education needs coordinator (SENCO) lead at school weekly and an occupational therapist - had computer use and extra time in exams. <br><br>He is not sure if he had an educational healthcare plan (EHCP). He was also allowed to wear ear plugs in school. He is going to meet with an Occupational therapist (OT) in the future to establish what support he can have for the future. <br><br>He finds it hard to interact with people, especially new people, does not understand what is going on and finds this anxiety inducing. He is not able to maintain relationships. He struggles to be in noisy environments and finds this overwhelming. <br><br>He feels that he has had these symptoms a lot longer than what they have been diagnosed. He struggles with sensory issues - loud noises, wet hands, high necks, being touched, strong smells. These are made worse by going outside. His symptoms are not variable unless he is outside and overall since secondary school they have not worsened.

            This was diagnosed in 2022/2023 by a rheumatologist. He had physiotherapy which did not help. Has been referred to the pain clinic, he has an assessment some time in April 2024. Has daily joint pain from doing things - affecting his wrist and hands (caused by using his computer). When he goes for walks, he will not be able to do anything else for the rest of the day due to lower limb joint pains. He has tried over the counter pain relief but these have not worked. He is awaiting pain clinic review. He has attended A&E for this pain in 2022 as the joint pain was very bad.<br><br>
            The pain has worsened over time. He has also been told that the fatigue symptoms that he experiences are as a result of his EDS by his rheumatologist. He has bad days where he is not able to leave the house due to fatigue - at least one day a week. He does suffer fatigue daily and takes supplements for this.

He will lash out when he is upset and distressed - this is verbally on a daily basis, to anyone who is nearby. This is due to reactive volatile moods. He has a fear of public paces, suffers with impulsive behaviour - when he is upset or manic, occurring most days), has active psychosis (has background talking which is distracting), is under the care of CMHT, has weekly therapy and is under a psychiatrist. He takes major anti depressants, anti psychotic medication and mood stabilisers. He has a recent diagnosis of ADHD and Autism, has been referred to an OT and take medication for ADHD. SOH shows that he has given up work due to his mental health issues.

Unaided is not likely to be adequate enough to mitigate the risk of overspending or not managing his financial affairs,
due to his anxiety, depression, autism, anxiety, disassociation, psychosis and intrusive thoughts as reported in the HOC, which also shows that his symptoms have gotten worse over the years.

<br><br>Whilst needs prompting or assistance to be able to make simple budgeting decisions has been considered due to his Autism. this is likely ruled out as there is no evidence noted within his FH and his MSE showed that he was able to cope with the assessment alone.
