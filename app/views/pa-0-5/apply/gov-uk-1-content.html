        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What PIP is for</h1>


        <p class="govuk-body">Personal Independence Payment (PIP) can help with extra living costs if you have both:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability</li>
          <li>difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around because of your condition</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can get PIP even if you’re working, have savings or are getting most other benefits.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can also <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/taliad-annibyniaeth-personol-pip">read about PIP in Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">How PIP works</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">There are 2 parts to PIP:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a daily living part - if you need help with everyday tasks</li>
          <li>a mobility part - if you need help with getting around</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Whether you get one or both parts and <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/pip/how-much-youll-get">how much you get</a> depends on how difficult you find everyday tasks and getting around.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">If you might have less than 12 months to live, you’ll automatically get the daily living part. Whether you get the mobility part depends on your needs. Find out <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/pip/claiming-if-you-might-have-12-months-or-less-to-live">how to claim and how much you’ll get if you might have 12 months or less to live</a>.</div>


        <h1 class="govuk-heading-s">Daily living part</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">You might get the daily living part of PIP if you need help with:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>preparing food</li>
          <li>eating and drinking</li>
          <li>managing your medicines or treatments</li>
          <li>washing and bathing</li>
          <li>using the toilet</li>
          <li>dressing and undressing</li>
          <li>reading</li>
          <li>managing your money</li>
          <li>socialising and being around other people</li>
          <li>talking, listening and understanding</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-s">Mobility part</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">You might get the mobility part of PIP if you need help with:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>working out a route and following it</li>
          <li>physically moving around</li>
          <li>leaving your home</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to have a physical disability to get the mobility part. You might also be eligible if you have difficulty getting around because of a cognitive or mental health condition, like anxiety.</p>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-s">How difficulty with tasks is assessed</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will assess how difficult you find daily living and mobility tasks. For each task they’ll look at:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>whether you can do it safely</li>
          <li>how long it takes you</li>
          <li>how often your condition affects this activity</li>
          <li>whether you need help to do it, from a person or using extra equipment</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">Your carer could get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance">Carer’s Allowance</a> if you have substantial caring needs.</div>


        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Help with PIP</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you need help understanding or applying for PIP you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>get help from <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/">Citizens Advice</a> </li>
          <li>watch PIP video guides with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0aQWFFHARy_lYZbrnJfuXzhKWotacfM">British Sign Language</a> </li>
          <li>use <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/about-pip-what-it-is-and-how-to-claim-it-easy-read-guide">easy read guides which explain PIP</a> </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">If you live in Scotland</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">You need to apply for <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment">Adult Disability Payment (ADP)</a> instead of PIP.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you currently get PIP, you’ll be automatically moved to ADP by summer 2024.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">When the move begins, you’ll get letters from DWP and Social Security Scotland. <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/personal-independence-payment-is-moving">Read more about the moving process.</a> </p>


        <h1 class="govuk-heading-s">If you move from Scotland to England or Wales</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you get ADP and move from Scotland to England or Wales, you must make a new claim for PIP instead.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Your ADP will stop 13 weeks after you move – apply for PIP as soon as possible after moving to avoid a gap between payments.</p>

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">If you get Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body"> <a href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit">Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</a> is being replaced by PIP for most adults. You’ll keep getting DLA if:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you’re under 16</li>
          <li>you were born on or before 8 April 1948</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you were born after 8 April 1948, DWP will invite you to apply for PIP. You do not need to do anything until DWP writes to you about your DLA unless your circumstances change.</p>
