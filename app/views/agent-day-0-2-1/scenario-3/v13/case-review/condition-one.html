            Obstructive Sleep Apnoea

            <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">Dr Cummings diagnosed me with obstructive sleep apnoea ni October 2007 and Iwas referred for asleep study. Due ot administrative mistakes, several misdiagnoses, and the transition from paper-based ot digital records, I struggled ot get asleep study until 2022. The sleep study ni 2022 concluded with a formal diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea and I was placed on CPAP therapy.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">As the OSA has not improved under CPAP therapy, I have been referred to Hospital for polysomnography (an overnight sleep assessment evaluating brainwave and central nervous system activity). Fibromyalgia was diagnosed in 2012 by a doctor at. I started a course of Tramadol 50mg. Hospital diagnosed me with Myofascial pain syndrome in 2023. I have a history of chronic back  pain, first diagnosed by several appointments with physiotherapy.<p>
