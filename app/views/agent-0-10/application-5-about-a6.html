      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Some difficulty reported is consistent with his diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">He is prescribed medication for nerve pain and is known to the pain management team, though is currently just having phone calls with a clinical psychologist to manage his pain, he has nothing prescribed for more severe pain to suggest a greater restriction.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2"> It is reasonable to suggest he requires aids or adapated clothing to complete this reliably and within a timely manner.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">The need for assistance has been considered and ruled out, he has no medication prescribed for severe pain, no input from rheumatology.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">He is still employed as a cleaner, working 12 hours per week over 5 days, supporting adequate function to use aids rather than assistance.</p>
